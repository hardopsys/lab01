Walkthrough (due 04/22/16):

-Explain how you would add your own hello world program so that you are able to execute it from the xv6 shell.
Modify the Makefile's USER_PROGS and UPROGS to allow the execution of program with a keyword (for example, just the command "hello").
Then take a template of an already complete program, make a copy of it, and change the copy so that it outputs "hello world". Also, edit the EXTRA part of the Makefile to include this new file.

-Track the operation of the wait system call using the debugger. Explain what happens when the process has no children, and when it has a child process.
When the process has no children, then it doesn't wait because there is nothing to wait for.
When the process has a child process, the main process will wait for the child to exit before continuing. This means that the main process is put into the waiting queue until the child is done executing and left in the ready queue when the child is done executing.

-Explain how the current scheduler works, including interaction with the timer.
The current scheduler is using Round Robin. It is preemptive because processes are paused when this method is used. The scheduler interacts with the timer interrupt by giving each process relatively small intervals of time to a process before pausing and switching.
